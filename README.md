How tu use the application:

1- Start the routing with ./main_routing {number of client (max 5)} {number of server (max3)}
1.1 : You just have to choose the number of client and server. Nothing more to do 

2- Start the server with ./main_server {number of the server (1-2-3)} {path to the file)}
2.1 : You have to choose the number of the server, the first one is 1,etc...
2.2 : After you have to put the path to the file, exemple: ../data/0001 for the first server, ../data/0002 for the second one, ...
2.3 : Once you did all these things you have nothing more to do. 

3- Start the client with ./main_client:
3.1 : Type 1 to access the choice menu or type any other thing to leave the client.
3.2 : Once you're on the choice menu type something like aaaa|bbbb|cccc to access to the menu.
      aaaa is the code for the server
      bbbb is the restaurant code
      cccc is the menu code
      exemple: 0001|0001|0001 for the first menu of the first restaurant of first server
3.3 : Once you asked for a menu, the client redirecting you to the initial menu.
